# KingTechnicalTest
Technical test that i did for King, couple of year ago i managed to pass the test and get an offer. 

Unfortunately the role for C# Unity programmer already closed. So they offer me to join their c++ team instead.

I made a hard decision to decline because CD ProjektRed offer me to join Cyberpunk team.

King is pretty solid studio, London is a great city to be in.

The test is pretty fun and i quite enjoy the final result.

- all level is automatically generated
- you can increase the difficulty by adding more piece type
- the shaders are custom so feel free to use it in your project :)
